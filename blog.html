			<h2>Help to Humanity Over Self</h2>
			<p class="blogtxt"
				>"Help to Humanity Over Self" is a term that embodies the principle of
				altruism, whereby one prioritizes the wellbeing of others over their own
				needs and desires. It is a key concept in the field of philanthropy and
				social service, emphasizing the importance of empathy, compassion, and
				selflessness in serving communities and improving people's lives. The
				philosophy behind "Help to Humanity Over Self" is grounded in the
				recognition that we all share a common humanity, and that it is our duty
				to use our resources and abilities for the greater good of society. In
				practice, this means putting aside our personal interests and investing
				time, energy, and resources into helping others in need. This can take
				many forms, from volunteering at a local charity organization to
				donating money to a cause we believe in. At its core, "Help to Humanity
				Over Self" reflects a deep-seated commitment to service and social
				responsibility, echoing the words of Mahatma Gandhi, who famously said,
				"the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of
				others." Indeed, by helping others, we become more connected to our
				fellow human beings, and we gain a sense of purpose and fulfillment that
				is difficult to find through individual pursuits alone. In the context
				of Nigeria, where poverty and inequality remain pervasive challenges,
				the concept of "Help to Humanity Over Self" holds particular
				significance. Non-governmental organizations like Aglow Aid Foundation
				(AGAF) are playing a critical role in addressing these issues, by
				providing critical services such as healthcare, education, and economic
				empowerment to vulnerable populations. AGAF's commitment to "Help to
				Humanity Over Self" is evident in its mission, which states that they
				exist to "provide holistic and integrated care to underprivileged
				populations across Nigeria, with a primary focus on women, children, and
				people living with disabilities." Through its various programs and
				initiatives, AGAF is working to address some of the key drivers of
				poverty and inequality in the country, by providing access to essential
				services and support networks that can help individuals and communities
				lift themselves out of poverty. That said, we encourage you to partner
				with us on reaching as many people as possible and making our vision a
				reality.</p
