						<h3>Mr John Umeojiako</h3>
						<p class="bio"
							>I was born and raised in Onitsha Anambra State. I went to school
							at Dennis Memorial Grammar School. After which I completed
							Associate Degree at Dallas College, Brookhaven Campus. My
							undergraduate was in Finance at Northeastern State University in
							Broken Arrow and I have a Masters in Cybersecurity from Western
							Governors University. Having been heavily involved in community
							engagement advocacy in Dallas TX when I was a student, I thought
							it wise to initiate an organization which will help a lot of
							diasporas to give back to Nigeria through investing in human
							beings and effecting a social change. That was how we gave birth
							to Aglow Aid Foundation. Our goal is to help humanity over self by
							developing projects and initiating community engagement activities
							to alleviate poverty of the soul and mind. Our goal is to change
							Nigeria, one man at a time. So, my team and I are determined to
							gather the resources needed from like minded individuals for these
							life changing projects.<br />
