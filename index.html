                <h3>John Umeojiako</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in Onitsha Anambra State. I went to school at Dennis Memorial Grammar School. After which I completed Associate Degree at Dallas College, Brookhaven Campus. My undergraduate was in Finance at Northeastern State University in Broken Arrow and I have a Masters in Cybersecurity from Western Governors University. 

                    Having been heavily involved in community engagement advocacy in Dallas TX when I was a student, I thought it wise to initiate an organization which will help a lot of diasporas to give back to Nigeria through investing in human beings and effecting a social change. That was how we gave birth to Aglow Aid Foundation. Our goal is to help humanity over self by developing projects and initiating community engagement activities to alleviate poverty of the soul and mind. Our goal is to change Nigeria, one man at a time. So, my team and I are determined to gather the resources needed from like minded individuals for these life changing projects.
                    
                    Regards,
                    Chukwuka John</p>
